##Setup Guide

###HOW TO START THE SERVER:
	
To Build this project, you have to move to the project directory where pom.xml is situated on your computer using
command prompt/terminal and execute the project using "mvn compile exec:java". This will start the server for the 
game of Webcheckers.

###HOW TO START THE GAME/CLIENT:
	
On the browser of your choice, navigate to "localhost:4567" This will open the window for one user. This same process
can be repeated for multiple users on different browser windows.
	
###SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
	
We have not implemented the king piece and king moves and the user stories still to be implemented are highlighted in
yellow in the Excel file for the acceptance test plan.
	
We have implemented the multiple jump move in a way that you have to do single jumps at a time and submit. It will still
continue to be your turn until all your jump moves are finished in that particular multiple jump move.
